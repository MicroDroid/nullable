Minimalistic and light-weight SQL databases manager. Supports **MySQL**, **SQL Server**, and **PostgresSQL.**

Grab a release [here!](https://github.com/MicroDroid/nullable/releases)

> This application is quite new and has very little amount of features *yet*, so bugs may arise. If nullable decides to delete your database please don't blame me, I warned you.

> I **highly** encourage you to open a [new issue](https://github.com/MicroDroid/nullable/issues/new) for every bug you encounter, and also for any feature you wish to be added to Nullable. Contributing directly the project via pull requests is highly appreicated too!
